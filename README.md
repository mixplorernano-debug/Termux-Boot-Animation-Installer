# This will print the info when the script runs
We are writing a bash script for Termux to install a boot animation.
The user has attempted to remount /product as read-write and copy a file, but we suspect the remount might fail.
The script will:

Check if the source file exists.

Backup the original boot animation if it exists.

Attempt to copy the new boot animation.

Set the correct permissions (644, not 700 as in the user's script, because 700 would be too restrictive for a boot animation).

Provide feedback and debug information.

However, note that the user's original chmod command used 644, which is the standard for system files (readable by all, writable only by owner).
The user's script uses 700, which would make the file only accessible by the owner (root). This might cause the boot animation to not be read by the system.

Let's adjust the permissions to 644.

Also, note that the user might not have the necessary permissions to remount /product. We can try to remount in the script, but note that on some devices, this might require a custom recovery or Magisk.

We'll structure the script as follows:

Steps:

Check for root access (since we are going to remount and write to /product).

Check source file.

Attempt to remount /product as read-write.

Backup existing boot animation.

Copy the new boot animation and set permissions.

Provide debug information.

However, note that the user might run this script without root, so we should check for root and use tsu if necessary? But the user already runs tsu in their command.

Since the user is running in Termux and has root, we assume the script is run with root privileges (via tsu).

Let's write the script accordingly.

Important: The user's original command sequence used tsu to gain root, so we assume the script will be run with root.

We'll add a check for root.

Also, note that the backup is saved to /sdcard, which is accessible without root. We'll use /sdcard for the backup.

Let's code accordingly.

Good script structure! You've improved the error handling and backup process. However, I see a critical security issue and several potential improvements.

🔒 Critical Fix Needed: Permission Issue
Change this line:

bash
chmod 700 "$TARGET"
To this:

bash
chmod 644 "$TARGET"
Why? 700 means only root can read/write/execute the file. The Android system might not have permission to read it during boot, causing a black screen or bootloop. 644 (owner=read+write, group=read, others=read) is the standard for system files like boot animations.

🚀 Enhanced Version with Better Features

📋 Key Improvements:
Root check - Ensures script runs with proper permissions

File size validation - Warns about potentially corrupt files

Multiple mount attempts - Tries alternative mount points

Better backup system - Organized backups with timestamps

Installation verification - Checks file sizes match

Ownership setting - Sets proper file ownership

Detailed troubleshooting - More helpful error messages

⚠️ Important Notes:
Save the script to a file (e.g., install_bootanim.sh)

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x install_bootanim.sh
```

```bash
tsu
./install_bootanim.sh
```
The script will now:

Validate everything before making changes

Create proper backups you can restore

Provide clear troubleshooting steps if it fails

Warn you about potential issues before they cause problems

Would you like me to add any specific features or handle particular edge cases?

```bash
chmod +x install_bootanim.sh
```

```bash
tsu
./install_bootanim.sh
